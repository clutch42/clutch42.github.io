            <h2>Project Narrative: Enhancing Code Readability</h2>
            <p><strong>Artifact Description:</strong> This project from CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization, completed in Fall 2023, demonstrates the use of OpenGL and C++ to create a dynamic 3D scene with advanced textures, lighting, and shading techniques.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification for Inclusion:</strong> Despite achieving its initial goals, the project's original code structure was disorganized, with all vertex and index generators located in a single .cpp file. This setup made the code hard to manage and extend.</p>
            <p><strong>Improvements and Enhancements:</strong> Significant improvements were made by refactoring the code to move vertex and index generators into separate header files. Each shape was encapsulated into its own class, enhancing readability and security. Constructors for varying shape sizes were added, providing more flexibility for future expansions.</p>
            
            <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
            <p>The enhancements made to this project effectively met the following course outcomes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Collaborative Coding Environment:</strong> The refactoring and modularization efforts contributed to a more collaborative coding environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Application of Computer Science Practices:</strong> Header files and structured practices improved code maintainability and scalability.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Code Security:</strong> A class-based structure and reduced global variables improved the security and robustness of the codebase.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Code Communication:</strong> Well-documented code and clear class definitions enhanced project communication.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Reflection on the Process</h2>
            <p>The project highlighted the importance of modular design and class encapsulation in managing complex systems. These improvements made the codebase easier to understand and extend. Future projects will benefit from more thorough initial planning to avoid structural issues. The choice between retaining the scaling method or adopting new instances proved challenging, but the current setup allows flexibility for future developments. Additionally, refactoring has removed magic numbers and replaced global variables with named constants, resulting in a cleaner codebase.</p>
