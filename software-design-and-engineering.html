            <h2>Project Narrative: Enhancing Code Readability and Structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Artifact Description:</strong> This project from CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization, completed in Fall 2023, demonstrates the 
                use of OpenGL and C++ to create a dynamic 3D scene with advanced textures, lighting, and shading techniques.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification for Inclusion:</strong> Despite achieving its initial goals, the project's original code structure was disorganized, with all 
                vertex and index generators located in a single .cpp file. This setup made the code hard to manage and extend.</p>
            <p><strong>Improvements and Enhancements:</strong> Significant improvements were made by refactoring the code to move vertex and index generators into 
                separate header files. Each shape was encapsulated into its own class, enhancing readability and security. Constructors for varying shape sizes were 
                added, providing more flexibility for future expansions.</p>
            
            <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
            <p>The enhancements made to this project effectively met the following course outcomes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Employ strategies for building collaborative environments:</strong> This was demonstrated by creating separate header files and classes for 
                    the vertex and index creation functions. The encapsulation of these functions into self-contained classes with private variables and public getters 
                    enables easy use by others and supports collaborative development.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality communications:</strong> This outcome is showcased through the detailed code review and narrative 
                    provided with the artifact. These documents offer coherent, technically sound insights into the project and its enhancements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles and standards:</strong> This is illustrated by the use of classes in the 
                    project. While adding some overhead, this approach improves code readability and reusability compared to simply moving functions to header files.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Demonstrate the use of innovative techniques and tools in computing:</strong> The project’s improvements, such as the creation of reusable classes, 
                    exemplify the use of well-founded techniques and tools to deliver valuable solutions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Develop a security mindset:</strong> By replacing public global variables with private variables and getters, the project enhances data and resource 
                    security, addressing potential vulnerabilities and design flaws.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Reflection on the Process</h2>
            <p>The project highlighted the importance of modular design and class encapsulation in managing complex systems. These improvements made the codebase easier to 
                understand and extend. Future projects will benefit from more thorough initial planning to avoid structural issues. The choice between retaining the scaling 
                method or adopting new instances proved challenging, but the current setup allows flexibility for future developments. Additionally, refactoring has removed 
                magic numbers and replaced global variables with named constants, resulting in a cleaner codebase.</p>
