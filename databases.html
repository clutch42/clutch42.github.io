            <h2>Code Review: Databases - SQLite in C++</h2>
            <p>This section provides a code review of the SQL injection prevention project in C++ with SQLite. The review evaluates the implementation of query 
                validation and identifies opportunities for enhancing security through parameterized queries and logging. Watch the video below for an in-depth 
                analysis of the codeâ€™s approach to handling SQL injection and its overall effectiveness.</p>

            <h2>Project Narrative: Enhancing Security</h2>
            <p><strong>Artifact Description:</strong> This project from CS-405 Secure Coding, completed in summer 2024, addresses SQL injection vulnerabilities in a C++ 
                program using SQLite. The initial version of the project used keyword detection to identify potential SQL injection attacks, focusing on flagging specific keywords.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification for Inclusion:</strong>  This project is included in my ePortfolio to demonstrate the application of secure coding principles in database 
                management. While the original method of keyword detection provided a basic level of security, it was inadequate for comprehensive protection. The enhancements 
                show an advanced understanding of SQL injection prevention techniques.</p>
            <p><strong>Improvements and Enhancements:</strong> Significant improvements include replacing keyword detection with parameterized SQL queries to robustly prevent SQL 
                injection attacks. Additionally, a logging database was added to track and analyze potential threats, providing better insight into the security status of the application.</p>
