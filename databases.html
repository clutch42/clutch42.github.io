            <h2>Code Review: Databases - SQLite in C++</h2>
            <p>This section provides a code review of the SQL injection prevention project in C++ with SQLite. The review evaluates the implementation of query 
                validation and identifies opportunities for enhancing security through parameterized queries and logging. Watch the video below for an in-depth 
                analysis of the codeâ€™s approach to handling SQL injection and its overall effectiveness.</p>

            <h2>Project Narrative: Enhancing Security</h2>
            <p><strong>Artifact Description:</strong> This project from CS-405 Secure Coding, completed in summer 2024, addresses SQL injection vulnerabilities in a C++ 
                program using SQLite. The initial version of the project used keyword detection to identify potential SQL injection attacks, focusing on flagging specific keywords.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification for Inclusion:</strong>  This project is included in my ePortfolio to demonstrate the application of secure coding principles in database 
                management. While the original method of keyword detection provided a basic level of security, it was inadequate for comprehensive protection. The enhancements 
                show an advanced understanding of SQL injection prevention techniques.</p>
            <p><strong>Improvements and Enhancements:</strong> Significant improvements include replacing keyword detection with parameterized SQL queries to robustly prevent SQL 
                injection attacks. Additionally, a logging database was added to track and analyze potential threats, providing better insight into the security status of the application.</p>

            <!-- Course Outcomes Section -->
            <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
            <p>The enhancements made to this project effectively met the following course outcomes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality communications:</strong> The detailed code review and narrative provide clear, technical insights into the 
                    project, demonstrating effective communication of complex concepts.</li>
                <li><strong>Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles and standards:</strong> By replacing keyword detection with parameterized SQL queries, the 
                    project employed robust methods for securing SQL queries, adhering to best practices in database security and ensuring effective protection against SQL injection.</li>
                <li><strong>Develop a security mindset:</strong> The addition of a logging database to monitor and analyze potential threats reflects a strong focus on proactive security 
                    measures. This enhancement underscores a commitment to identifying and addressing vulnerabilities comprehensively.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Reflection Section -->
            <h2>Reflection on the Process</h2>
            <p>Enhancing this project highlighted the need for early security integration. While familiar with SQL, I was new to SQLite, making the experience both challenging and rewarding. 
                Implementing parameterized queries was straightforward, but adding a logging database introduced complexity. Despite concerns about overhead, detailed transaction logs proved 
                valuable for security and monitoring. This process improved system security and expanded my knowledge of SQLite.</p>
