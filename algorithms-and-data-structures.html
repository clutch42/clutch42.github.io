            <h2>Code Review: Data Structures and Algorithms - Binary Search Tree in C++</h2>
            <p>This section provides a comprehensive code review of the Binary Search Tree implementation. The review covers the structure of the code, 
                its functionality, and identifies areas for improvement. The analysis focuses on how well the code handles various operations such as 
                insertion, deletion, and search. Watch the video below to gain insights into the code's design and performance characteristics.</p>

            <h2>Project Narrative: Enhancing Efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Artifact Description:</strong> This project, completed as part of CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms â€“ Analysis and Design in the 
                summer of 2023, demonstrates the implementation of a binary search tree using C++. The primary objective of this assignment was to develop a 
                program that efficiently manages and processes a list of bids contained in a .csv file. The project involved parsing the .csv file to construct 
                a binary search tree, performing operations such as in-order traversal to display bids, and executing search and deletion operations on specific 
                bids. The artifact showcases the foundational principles of data structures through practical application in handling real-world data.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification for Inclusion:</strong>  The project was selected for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it represents a fundamental aspect 
                of computer science and showcases my understanding and application of key concepts in data structures and algorithms. Initially, the BST implementation 
                was straightforward but lacked efficiency and proper balancing. This led to performance issues, especially with large datasets. Ensuring a balanced 
                tree is crucial for maintaining efficient search and delete operations, which is why this project was a perfect candidate to demonstrate these principles.</p>
            <p><strong>Improvements and Enhancements:</strong> To enhance the artifact, I replaced the initial wrapper function with an AVL tree implementation, which 
                is a self-balancing binary search tree. This change introduced rotation operations and modified insertion and deletion functions to maintain tree 
                balance, ensuring that search and delete operations perform at O(log n) time complexity. I also tested the AVL tree against other methods to validate 
                its efficiency, updated the menu for dynamic bid input, and improved functionality by using a function object in the in-order traversal for greater flexibility.</p>
