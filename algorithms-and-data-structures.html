            <h2>Code Review: Data Structures and Algorithms - Binary Search Tree in C++</h2>
            <p>This section provides a comprehensive code review of the Binary Search Tree implementation. The review covers the structure of the code, 
                its functionality, and identifies areas for improvement. The analysis focuses on how well the code handles various operations such as 
                insertion, deletion, and search. Watch the video below to gain insights into the code's design and performance characteristics.</p>

            <h2>Before and After: Enhancements to the Code</h2>
            <p>Hightlights the key improvements made to the project by comparing the initial and enhanced versions. The links below provide access to the 
                original code and the updated version using an AVL tree.</p>

            <h2>Project Narrative: Enhancing Efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Artifact Description:</strong> This project from CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms, completed in summer 2023, involves creating a binary search 
                tree in C++. It parses a .csv file to manage bids, performs in-order traversal, and supports search and deletion operations, illustrating key data structure concepts.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification for Inclusion:</strong>  The project is included in my ePortfolio to showcase my understanding of data structures and algorithms. While initially 
                functional, the original BST lacked efficiency with large datasets. This project highlights the importance of balanced trees for optimal performance.</p>
            <p><strong>Improvements and Enhancements:</strong> I upgraded the BST to an AVL tree, implementing rotation operations and adjustments to maintain balance, which improved 
                performance to O(log n). I tested its efficiency, updated the menu for dynamic input, and enhanced functionality with a flexible in-order traversal using function objects.</p>
