            <p>This section provides a comprehensive code review of the Binary Search Tree implementation. The review covers the structure of the code, 
                its functionality, and identifies areas for improvement. The analysis focuses on how well the code handles various operations such as 
                insertion, deletion, and search. Watch the video below to gain insights into the code's design and performance characteristics.</p>

            <h2 id="summary">Project Narrative: Enhancing Efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Artifact Description:</strong> This project from CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms, completed in summer 2023, involves creating a binary search 
                tree in C++. It parses a .csv file to manage bids, performs in-order traversal, and supports search and deletion operations, illustrating key data structure concepts.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification for Inclusion:</strong>  The project is included in my ePortfolio to showcase my understanding of data structures and algorithms. While initially 
                functional, the original BST lacked efficiency with large datasets. This project highlights the importance of balanced trees for optimal performance.</p>
            <p><strong>Improvements and Enhancements:</strong> I upgraded the BST to an AVL tree, implementing rotation operations and adjustments to maintain balance, which improved 
                performance to O(log n). I tested its efficiency, updated the menu for dynamic input, and enhanced functionality with a flexible in-order traversal using function objects.</p>

            <!-- Course Outcomes Section -->
            <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
            <p>The enhancements made to this project effectively met the following course outcomes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality communications:</strong> The detailed code review and narrative provide clear, technical insights into the project, 
                    demonstrating effective communication of complex concepts.</li>
                <li><strong>Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles and standards:</strong> The use of the AVL tree illustrates the application of algorithmic 
                    principles to improve efficiency and performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Demonstrate the use of innovative techniques and tools in computing:</strong> Implementing the AVL tree highlights the use of advanced techniques to enhance the 
                    project's overall performance and functionality.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Reflection Section -->
            <h2>Reflection on the Process</h2>
            <p>Initially, I aimed to balance the Binary Search Tree to optimize bid searches. I started with a wrapper function but found it inadequate due to frequent imbalances. Implementing an 
                AVL tree, which maintains O(log n) performance, significantly improved efficiency. This experience highlighted the importance of selecting the right data structure to address 
                performance challenges effectively.</p>
