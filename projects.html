            <p>
                The CS-465 project at Southern New Hampshire University focuses on developing a full-stack web application using the MEAN stack, 
                which includes MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database, where data is stored in a 
                flexible, JSON-like format, utilizing the Mongoose library for object modeling and schema validation. Express.js is employed as 
                the back-end framework, creating a RESTful API that handles CRUD operations and integrates middleware such as body-parser, 
                cookie-parser, and morgan. It also uses authentication strategies provided by the passport library and JWT for secure user 
                authentication.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the front end, Angular is utilized to build a dynamic user interface, incorporating features such as reactive forms from the 
                @angular/forms library and routing through @angular/router. Key services include TripDataService and AuthenticationService, which 
                manage data fetching and user authentication, respectively. The application leverages various models like User and Trip for 
                structured data handling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The front-end design is made responsive with custom CSS, ensuring a mobile-friendly experience. Additionally, SNHU provided starter 
                code that included HTML, CSS, and images to assist with the visual aspects of the project. This setup allowed me to focus more on 
                back-end functionality and the integration of MEAN stack technologies while maintaining a cohesive design throughout the application.
