            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p>
                As I approach the completion of my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), this portfolio represents the culmination of my academic 
                journey and hands-on experiences. I began this program two years ago, following the transfer of general education and some higher-level math and science credits 
                from the University of Houston and Houston Community College. The majority of my computer science education has been through SNHU, where I have gained invaluable insights and skills.

            <h3>Shaping My Professional Goals and Values</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout my coursework and the development of this ePortfolio, I have refined my professional goals and values. Key lessons from the program include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Effective Planning:</strong> Learning to use pseudocode, flowcharts, and other tools to plan applications efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Custom Data Structures:</strong> Creating and utilizing custom data structures to enhance programming efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Security in Programming:</strong> Integrating security practices early in development to protect applications from vulnerabilities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These experiences have solidified my commitment to creating secure, efficient, and maintainable software solutions.

            <h2>Key Competencies</h2>
            <p>
                My education and projects have equipped me with several key competencies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Collaborating in a Team Environment:</strong> My projects have involved teamwork, where I have learned the importance of effective communication 
                    and collaboration. Notable courses like CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle and CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance emphasized 
                    the role of teamwork and communication in developing high-quality software.</li>
                <li><strong>Communicating with Stakeholders:</strong> Clear and effective communication has been crucial. Courses such as CS-255: System Analysis and Design 
                    and CS-319: UI/UX Design and Development have reinforced my ability to present technical concepts and design decisions clearly to various audiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms:</strong> I have developed a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms. CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms: 
                    Analysis and Design provided advanced insights into algorithmic design and problem-solving.</li>
                <li><strong>Software Engineering and Databases:</strong> Practical experience in software engineering and database management has been gained through courses 
                    like DAD-220: Introduction to Structured Database Environments and CS-340: Client/Server Development. These courses emphasized designing scalable solutions, 
                    managing data efficiently, and developing client/server applications. My experience with the MEAN stack in CS-465: Full Stack Development has further refined 
                    my skills in building robust web applications and managing databases.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Implementing security practices has been a significant focus. CS-405: Secure Coding and CS-305: Software Security provided deep dives 
                    into secure coding techniques, vulnerability mitigation, and encryption technologies.</li>
            </ul>
