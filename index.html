            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p>
                As I approach the completion of my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), this portfolio represents the culmination of my academic 
                journey and hands-on experiences. I began this program two years ago, following the transfer of general education and some higher-level math and science credits 
                from the University of Houston and Houston Community College. The majority of my computer science education has been through SNHU, where I have gained invaluable insights and skills.

            <h3>Shaping My Professional Goals and Values</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout my coursework and the development of this ePortfolio, I have refined my professional goals and values. Key lessons from the program include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Effective Planning:</strong> Learning to use pseudocode, flowcharts, and other tools to plan applications efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Custom Data Structures:</strong> Creating and utilizing custom data structures to enhance programming efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Security in Programming:</strong> Integrating security practices early in development to protect applications from vulnerabilities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These experiences have solidified my commitment to creating secure, efficient, and maintainable software solutions.
