            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p>
                As I approach the completion of my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), this portfolio represents the culmination of my academic 
                journey and hands-on experiences. I began this program two years ago, following the transfer of general education and some higher-level math and science credits 
                from the University of Houston and Houston Community College. The majority of my computer science education has been through SNHU, where I have gained invaluable insights and skills.
